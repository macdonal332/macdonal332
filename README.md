### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Tech is what CrossHelmet trades on. It attempts to wow you with cool-sounding features, but do they work and are they useful?

CrossHelmet â€“ The Smart Motorcycle Helmet with HUD

The HUD sits at the top of your field of vision, like a rear view mirror in a car. It connects to the camera mounted at the back of the lid, letting you see everything going on behind you.

You can overlay GPS directions or weather updates to the display, too.

Here are some of the issues youâ€™ll find with the HUD:

Itâ€™s not sturdy and will bounce about, so itâ€™s hard to focus
If youâ€™ve got a passenger, youâ€™ll only see their visor behind you
In sunlight, the display is impossible to see
You canâ€™t wear your shades and see the display
Maps only work with the CrossHelmet apps, which only shows distances in KM

The HUD claims to extend your field of vision to 360Â° but in reality, you might not be able to see things as soon as they leave your eye line.

CrossHelmet X1â€™s Sound Control

The CrossSound Control is a noise cancellation feature. It should allow you to choose if you want to have environmental sounds coming in or not.
